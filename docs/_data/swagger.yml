                                            If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different
                                            than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix.
                                            The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field,
                                            and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value
                                            unique on the server.

                                            If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will return a 409.

                                            DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This
                                            field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not
                                            directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
                                            from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the
                                            finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked.
                                            Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the
                                            future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time.
                                            For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react
                                            by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds,
                                            the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,
                                            remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still
                                            exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the

                                            in this list can only be removed.
                                            Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced
                                            because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers.
                                            finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it.
                                            If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation
                                            in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is
                                            waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a
                                            component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.
                                            Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and
                                            are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

                                                    in-range (as per system configuration), and is not in use, it will be
                                                    allocated to the service; otherwise creation of the service will fail.
                                                    This field may not be changed through updates unless the type field is
                                                    also being changed to ExternalName (which requires this field to be
                                                    empty) or the type field is being changed from ExternalName (in which
                                                    case this field may optionally be specified, as describe above).  Valid
                                                    values are "None", empty string (""), or a valid IP address.  Setting
                                                    this to "None" makes a "headless service" (no virtual IP), which is
                                                    useful when direct endpoint connections are preferred and proxying is
                                                    not required.  Only applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort, and
                                                    LoadBalancer. If this field is specified when creating a Service of type
                                                    ExternalName, creation will fail. This field will be wiped when updating
                                                    a Service to type ExternalName.  If this field is not specified, it will
                                                    be initialized from the clusterIP field.  If this field is specified,
                                                    clients must ensure that clusterIPs[0] and clusterIP have the same
                                                    value.

                                                    This field may hold a maximum of two entries (dual-stack IPs, in either order).
                                                    These IPs must correspond to the values of the ipFamilies field. Both
                                                    clusterIPs and ipFamilies are governed by the ipFamilyPolicy field.

                                            UID is a type that holds unique ID values, including UUIDs.  Because we
                                            don't ONLY use UUIDs, this is an alias to string.  Being a type captures
                                            intent and helps make sure that UIDs and names do not get conflated.

                                            DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This
                                            field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not
                                            directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
                                            from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the
                                            finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked.
                                            Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the
                                            future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time.
                                            For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react
                                            by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds,
                                            the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,
                                            remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still
                                            exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the
                                            resource is fully terminated.
                                            If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

                                            GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique
                                            name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided.
                                            If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different
                                            than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix.
                                            The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field,
                                            and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value
                                            unique on the server.

                                            If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will return a 409.

                                                    IPFamilies is a list of IP families (e.g. IPv4, IPv6) assigned to this
                                                    service. This field is usually assigned automatically based on cluster
                                                    configuration and the ipFamilyPolicy field. If this field is specified
                                                    manually, the requested family is available in the cluster,
                                                    and ipFamilyPolicy allows it, it will be used; otherwise creation of
                                                    the service will fail. This field is conditionally mutable: it allows
                                                    for adding or removing a secondary IP family, but it does not allow
                                                    changing the primary IP family of the Service. Valid values are "IPv4"
                                                    and "IPv6".  This field only applies to Services of types ClusterIP,
                                                    NodePort, and LoadBalancer, and does apply to "headless" services.
                                                    This field will be wiped when updating a Service to type ExternalName.

                                                    This field may hold a maximum of two entries (dual-stack families, in
                                                    either order).  These families must correspond to the values of the
                                                    clusterIPs field, if specified. Both clusterIPs and ipFamilies are
                                                    governed by the ipFamilyPolicy field.

                                            Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced
                                            because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers.
                                            finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it.
                                            If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation
                                            in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is
                                            waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a
                                            component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.
                                            Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and
                                            are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

                                            that are managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal
                                            housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set or
                                            understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a
                                            controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like
                                            "ci-cd". The set of fields is always in the version that the
                                            workflow used when modifying the object.

                                            because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers.
                                            finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it.
                                            If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation
                                            in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is
                                            waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a
                                            component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.
                                            Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and
                                            are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

                                            DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This
                                            field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not
                                            directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
                                            from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the
                                            finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked.
                                            Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the
                                            future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time.
                                            For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react
                                            by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds,
                                            the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,
                                            remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still
                                            exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the
                                            resource is fully terminated.
                                            If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

                                            Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested.

                                                        intent and helps make sure that UIDs and names do not get conflated.

                    If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different
                    than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix.
                    The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field,
                    and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value
                    unique on the server.

                    If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will return a 409.

                    understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a
                    controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like
                    "ci-cd". The set of fields is always in the version that the

                description: |-
                    DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This
                    field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not
                    directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
                    from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the
                    finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked.
                    Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the
                    future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time.
                    For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react
                    by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds,
                    the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,
                    remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still
                    exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the
                    resource is fully terminated.
                    If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

                    Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested.

            finalizers:
                description: |-
                    Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry
                    is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry
                    from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries
                    in this list can only be removed.
                    Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced
                    because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers.
                    finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it.
                    If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation
                    in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is
                    waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a
                    component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.
                    Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and
                    are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

                    UID is a type that holds unique ID values, including UUIDs.  Because we
                    don't ONLY use UUIDs, this is an alias to string.  Being a type captures
                    intent and helps make sure that UIDs and names do not get conflated.

            UID is a type that holds unique ID values, including UUIDs.  Because we
            don't ONLY use UUIDs, this is an alias to string.  Being a type captures
            intent and helps make sure that UIDs and names do not get conflated.

            Each key is either a '.' representing the field itself, and will always map to an empty set,

            'v:<value>', where <value> is the exact json formatted value of a list item

            'k:<keys>', where <keys> is a map of  a list item's key fields to their unique values
            If a key maps to an empty Fields value, the field that key represents is part of the set.

            IntOrString is a type that can hold an int32 or a string.  When used in
            JSON or YAML marshalling and unmarshalling, it produces or consumes the
            inner type.  This allows you to have, for example, a JSON field that can
            accept a name or number.

                    As of Kubernetes v1.24, users are encouraged to use implementation-specific annotations when available.

                                IntOrString is a type that can hold an int32 or a string.  When used in
                                JSON or YAML marshalling and unmarshalling, it produces or consumes the
                                inner type.  This allows you to have, for example, a JSON field that can
                                accept a name or number.

                    publishNotReadyAddresses indicates that any agent which deals with endpoints for this
                    Service should disregard any indications of ready/not-ready.
                    The primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service to
                    propagate SRV DNS records for its Pods for the purpose of peer discovery.
                    The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and EndpointSlice resources for
                    Services interpret this to mean that all endpoints are considered "ready" even if the
                    Pods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints
                    through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.

            Example generated code:

            type M struct {
            state protoimpl.MessageState

            Field1 int32
            Field2 string
            Field3 *BarMessage
            ...
            }

            func (m *M) ProtoReflect() protoreflect.Message {
            mi := &file_fizz_buzz_proto_msgInfos[5]
            if protoimpl.UnsafeEnabled && m != nil {
            ms := protoimpl.X.MessageStateOf(Pointer(m))
            if ms.LoadMessageInfo() == nil {
            ms.StoreMessageInfo(mi)
            }
            return ms
            }
            return mi.MessageOf(m)
            }

            The MessageState type holds a *MessageInfo, which must be atomically set to
            the message info associated with a given message instance.
            By unsafely converting a *M into a *MessageState, the MessageState object
            has access to all the information needed to implement protobuf reflection.
            It has access to the message info as its first field, and a pointer to the
            MessageState is identical to a pointer to the concrete message value.

            Requirements:
            The type M must implement protoreflect.ProtoMessage.
            The address of m must not be nil.
            The address of m and the address of m.state must be equal,
            even though they are different Go types.

            MessageState is a data structure that is nested as the first field in a
            concrete message. It provides a way to implement the ProtoReflect method
            in an allocation-free way without needing to have a shadow Go type generated
            for every message type. This technique only works using unsafe.

                                        ClusterIPs is a list of IP addresses assigned to this service, and are
                                        usually assigned randomly.  If an address is specified manually, is
                                        in-range (as per system configuration), and is not in use, it will be
                                        allocated to the service; otherwise creation of the service will fail.
                                        This field may not be changed through updates unless the type field is
                                        also being changed to ExternalName (which requires this field to be
                                        empty) or the type field is being changed from ExternalName (in which
                                        case this field may optionally be specified, as describe above).  Valid
                                        values are "None", empty string (""), or a valid IP address.  Setting
                                        this to "None" makes a "headless service" (no virtual IP), which is
                                        useful when direct endpoint connections are preferred and proxying is
                                        not required.  Only applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort, and
                                        LoadBalancer. If this field is specified when creating a Service of type
                                        ExternalName, creation will fail. This field will be wiped when updating
                                        a Service to type ExternalName.  If this field is not specified, it will
                                        be initialized from the clusterIP field.  If this field is specified,
                                        clients must ensure that clusterIPs[0] and clusterIP have the same
                                        value.

                                        This field may hold a maximum of two entries (dual-stack IPs, in either order).
                                        These IPs must correspond to the values of the ipFamilies field. Both
                                        clusterIPs and ipFamilies are governed by the ipFamilyPolicy field.

                                from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries
                                in this list can only be removed.
                                Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced
                                because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers.
                                finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it.
                                If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation
                                in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is
                                waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a
                                component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.
                                Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and
                                are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

                                directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
                                from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the
                                finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked.
                                Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the
                                future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time.
                                For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react
                                by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds,
                                the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,
                                remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still
                                exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the
                                resource is fully terminated.
                                If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

                                and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value
                                unique on the server.

                        will answer requests sent through the proxy.
